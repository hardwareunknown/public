quad-cannon-nunchuk.ino is the file I used for my personal launcher in the demo video.

*** DISCLAIMER***: ***I am a hobbyist, not a programming professional.

I am providing the code in this repository as examples of what you can use for your projects.
The files have not been tested by professionals, and ***NONE OF THEM ARE GUARANTEED TO BE BUG-FREE.***

***Using code that you have not fully tested for issues (including the files posted here) COULD
CAUSE YOUR CANNON TO FIRE WHEN YOU DO NOT INTEND IT TO, EVEN WITHOUT YOU PHYSICALLY PUSHING THE FIRE
BUTTON/TRIGGER/ETC., CAUSING DAMAGE, INJURY, OR DEATH.***

Make sure you test all the code with the cannons depressurized to ensure they work as intended before adding
any air pressure. This does not guarantee your safety, but it may reduce the risk of injury. If you choose to
build this project (and other potentially dangerous projects), you do so at your own risk. I do not accept any
responsibility for any/all damage, injuries, or death related to your building or use of a similar device.
Check your local laws before making an air cannon, as some cities, counties, and states do not allow them.

*I'm assuming my own risks using the code included in this repository and you need to do so as well if you
choose to use it yourself.*
